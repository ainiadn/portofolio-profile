    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>
      Hi! I'm Aini, currently a university student majoring in Information Systems at Gunadarma.
      Since I was young, I've always enjoyed exploring how things work‚Äîespecially when it comes to computers, websites, and digital creativity.
      My journey into tech started with simple HTML experiments and slowly grew into building web pages and small apps.
      It began as curiosity, and turned into something I truly enjoy: building interfaces that feel clean, soft, and thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      I discovered that coding isn‚Äôt just about syntax‚Äîit‚Äôs also about bringing ideas to life. 
      My favorite part? The joy of arranging pixels and fixing layout bugs at 2AM.

    <h2>Things I've Built</h2>
    <p>
      I've been learning front-end development since 2022, and over time, I've built several personal projects like a Studio Ghibli landing page, a personal notes app, and a digital bookshelf.
      I mainly use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Bootstrap, and tools like Git and Visual Studio Code.
      Every project has helped me deepen my understanding while enjoying the challenge of logic and design.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy creating simple web projects that start from scratch and grow into something real. 
      Whether it's a minimalist web app or a small growth tracker, I love seeing small ideas become usable things.
    </p>

    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <p>
      Though I have a background in programming, I also have a deep interest in business and design.
      That's why I love working on side projects that combine both tech and creativity‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs designing a minimalist web app or building a small fashion brand from scratch.
      For me, tech is more than just a skill; it's a tool to shape my own path.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm the type of person who gets excited by small details ‚Äî like a good font pairing or a beautifully structured code.
      I value growth, softness, and making things that are not just functional, but also feel warm to interact with.
      Outside of tech, I find joy in journaling, desk decor, soft fashion, and finding cozy corners to work in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Personality-wise, I'm intuitive, observant, and quietly driven. I enjoy meaningful conversations, love learning from others, and often find clarity during quiet moments.
      I'm not someone who rushes things‚ÄîI believe growth takes time. Right now, I'm focused on improving myself through coding, side hustles, and discovering what truly excites me.
    </p>
    <div class="fun-fact-box">
      üå∏ <strong>Fun fact:</strong> I‚Äôm usually the calm one in a group, but I get way too passionate when I talk about beautiful UI, studio Ghibli, or soft pink aesthetics.

    <h2>What I'm Exploring</h2>
    <p>
      I'm currently diving deeper into front-end web development while also learning how to build a sustainable brand and business.
      I dream of combining both ‚Äî tech and creativity ‚Äî into something meaningful.
      Still exploring, still building, and still dreaming. Let‚Äôs grow together ‚ú®
